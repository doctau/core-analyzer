Introduction
=====================================================
This tool is intended to shed light on the cause of a core dump, and/or get more insight of complex cross-references between numerous data objects. A core dump file is usually generated by OS due to severe error, such like segmentation fault or access violation. It could also be created by user for offline investigation. Currently the tool runs on Linux and Win64. Support for other platforms is under way.

Core analyzer uses similar command line to load a core dump file as a debugger. Option -b enables batch mode which prints core information, scan heap memory and exits without interactive menus.

Linux
$core_analyzer [-b] <exec_name> <core>

Windows
$core_analyzer [-b] <core>

How to Build
=====================================================
Source and header files are under the root directory core_analyzer_2_2. You will find the executables under
/Linux/core_analyzer
/Windows/x64/core_anazlyer.exe

If you want to build by yourself, it is quite easy as well. On Linux, change directory into /core_analyzer_2_3/Linux, then
$make

For the Window platform, you may use visual studio to build the project. Create a console project and include all header and cpp source files.
